Weighing in at around 500 pouds, Griffins survive on a diet consisting of a small party (3-5) of Adventurers. The Adventurers may come from various races ranging from fey sprites to hulking ogres. By and large, though, their prey are typically huminoid.

Famous adventurers that have been known to be consumed by Griffons include [Drizzt Do'urden](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Drizzt_Do%27Urden), and the mage [Elminster](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Elminster_Aumar) in [The Battle of Evermore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b0OYxdtyM).
